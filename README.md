# Movie Database Analysis

### A Data Science Project

## Overview

The film industry generates vast amounts of structured data related to movies, genres, ratings, revenues, and audience preferences. This project applies **data science techniques** to analyze a movie database and extract insights about trends, popularity, and performance metrics across different types of films.

The project demonstrates a complete **data analysis pipeline**, from data preprocessing to exploratory analysis and insight generation, using real-world movie data.

## Problem Statement

Movies vary widely in terms of popularity, ratings, and financial success. Understanding the factors behind these variations is valuable for analysts, production houses, and streaming platforms.

This project focuses on answering questions such as:

* How do ratings vary across genres and time?
* What trends exist in movie production and popularity?
* Are there observable patterns between movie attributes and audience response?

---

## Dataset

The dataset consists of structured movie-related attributes, including:

* Movie title
* Genre(s)
* Release year
* Ratings and votes
* Popularity or performance indicators

> The dataset is used strictly for analytical and educational purposes.
